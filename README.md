## Credit Card Fault Detection Project
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting if the credit card holder will default the next month or not using the datasets 22 features features.


The Dataset detailed information is available on : https://github.com/rachitdani/Credit-Card-Fault-Detection-Project/blob/113bbaab6abe2790af3c58ac339913dd0944c96d/notebooks/EDA%20%26%20Model%20Training.ipynb

This project is a an example of Binary Classification Problem. We have used multiple Classification algorithms and the best algorithm is used for the prediction.

List of models the project uses to train on the dataset -
* Logistic Regression
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Random Forest Regressor
* Gradient Boosting
* Decision Tree
* XGboost

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Sumeetparmar0/Credit-Card-Fault-Detection-Project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: 

cd Credit-Card-Fault-Detection-Project

Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Flask application: python application.py

4. Open your web browser and go to
